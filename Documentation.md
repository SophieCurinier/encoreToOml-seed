# Documentation - Explaination

## Abstract

The "Electronic Data Sheets (EDS) for Space Systems" project is a pioneering initiative aiming to revolutionize the documentation and interfacing standards within the space industry. 
Traditionally, space missions involve the integration of multifaceted subsystems, each necessitating precise, yet diverse, documentation. This heterogeneity in documentation standards not only complicates the design and integration process but also heightens the risk of human error, potentially jeopardizing mission success.

This project introduces the standardization of EDS, transitioning from varied, often over-complicated documentation to a unified, machine-readable format. EDS encapsulate vital details such as electrical connections, data interfaces, and operational protocols, ensuring unambiguous, standardized, and easily interpretable data across different systems. 
This standardization is anticipated to significantly reduce interpretational errors, streamline system integration processes, and facilitate the automatic generation of engineering artifacts, thereby accelerating the mission design lifecycle.

Two parallel approaches underpin the project: enhancing the existing digital format within the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS) architecture and leveraging the Space Avionics Open Interface Architecture (SAVOIR) for a comprehensive European EDS format. This interoperability is expected to extend throughout the entire mission lifecycle, simplifying tasks like validation and interface compatibility checks.

The project's culmination will see the integration of EDS into real-life space applications, marking a significant stride in space systems engineering.

Our work is to create a Domain Specific Model Language to challenge this problem.

## Challenges

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) stands at the forefront of addressing complex challenges in the modeling and generation of domain-specific models, particularly in sophisticated fields like space systems engineering. 
The introduction of Electronic Data Sheets (EDS) within this domain underscores a critical need for a standardized, unambiguous system representation that can be easily interpreted, shared, and implemented across various platforms and among diverse stakeholders.

One of the primary challenges in this domain is the sheer complexity and heterogeneity of systems involved in space missions. Traditional engineering approaches often fall short in managing this complexity, leading to inefficiencies, increased error margins, and escalated costs. MDE addresses this by abstracting the complexity through high-level models that are simpler to understand, manipulate, and communicate. These models, representing the system's functionalities and behaviors in a standardized manner, are paramount in EDS, ensuring consistency in documentation and interpretation.

Moreover, the space industry's traditional documentation is fraught with risks of misinterpretation, inconsistencies, and difficulty in validation. MDE's emphasis on using formalized and standardized models mitigates these issues. With EDS, MDE facilitates the creation of precise, machine-readable, and verifiable specifications for system components. These specifications can be consistently used across various stages of system design, implementation, and operation, reducing discrepancies and enhancing system integrity.

Another significant challenge is the manual generation of system artifacts, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. MDE excels by enabling the automatic generation of these artifacts from the established models, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and significant time savings. In the context of EDS, this capability is invaluable. By defining system interfaces and behaviors through EDS, engineers can automatically generate code, configuration files, and documentation, thereby accelerating the development cycle and reducing human error.

Furthermore, system evolution and scalability pose substantial challenges, especially in an industry where technology is ever-evolving. MDE supports scalability and adaptability through its model abstraction philosophy. As systems evolve, the underlying models in EDS can be easily updated, and corresponding system artifacts can be regenerated, ensuring the system remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

Finally, the integration of systems from different vendors is a common hurdle due to varied interface and interaction specifications. EDS, developed through MDE principles, act as a common language, ensuring that components from different vendors are interoperable. This standardization is crucial for the successful integration and operation of space systems, reducing integration issues that arise from incompatible components.

In conclusion, MDE's application in the development and utilization of EDS addresses several challenges inherent in space systems engineering. By providing a standardized, scalable, and efficient approach to system specification and implementation, MDE significantly enhances the reliability, consistency, and interoperability of these advanced systems.

## Previous work

A significant precursor in the field was the development of the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS) architecture under the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). SOIS set out to standardize data handling and communications for space systems, and its EDS standard marked a pivotal shift towards machine-readable specifications. This initiative highlighted the potential for reducing human error and streamlining system integration by adopting a standardized approach to documenting system components and interfaces.

Concurrently, the Space Avionics Open Interface Architecture (SAVOIR) initiative sought to federate the development of European space systems. SAVOIR's aim to establish common specifications and interfaces resonated with the goals of EDS, emphasizing the need for a unified language in space systems engineering. The convergence of these initiatives underscored the industry's growing consensus on the importance of standardization for ensuring system interoperability and reducing complexity.

The application of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) in EDS also stands out. Leveraging EMF's capabilities, researchers experimented with generating ecore metamodels from EDS schemas. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using MDE tools to create, visualize, and validate EDS, setting a precedent for the current project's ambitions. It also highlighted the potential for automating the generation of engineering artifacts from EDS, a capability that is central to the current project.

NASA's integration of EDS into its core Flight System (cFS) software marked another milestone. This integration showcased the practical benefits of EDS in real-world space systems, highlighting how EDS can enhance system reliability, facilitate component interoperability, and streamline the system development lifecycle. The cFS initiative provided valuable insights into the challenges and best practices for integrating EDS into complex systems, informing subsequent efforts in this domain.

Furthermore, the TASTE toolset, a model-driven development environment for real-time systems, has been instrumental in bridging the gap between EDS and system implementation. By enabling the automatic generation of system artifacts from EDS models, TASTE has demonstrated the efficiency gains and error reduction that can be achieved through MDE principles.

These previous works collectively highlight the industry's trajectory towards standardized, model-driven approaches to space systems engineering. They reflect the growing recognition of the benefits of EDS and MDE, from enhancing system interoperability and reliability to reducing development time and costs. As the current project builds on these foundations, it seeks to further these benefits by broadening the application of EDS and MDE principles in the space industry.
